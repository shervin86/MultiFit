Standalone for MultiFit

First, one need to install "eigen" if it is not installed already



EXAMPLE 01 is the most trivial case:
--------------------------------------

- Pulse shape is alpha-beta function that describes EEShape.cc from CMSSW
- Samples have *uncorrelated* noise fluctuations
- No OOT pileup

To compile and run:
g++ -o exercise_01 exercise_01.cc PulseChiSqSNNLS.cc -std=c++11 `root-config --cflags --glibs`
./exercise_01

Ruuning time is about few minutes on 2.4 GHz Intel i7 processor

Histograms are stored in "output.root" file

EXAMPLE 11
------------

- Pulse shape is alpha-beta function that describes EEShape.cc from CMSSW
- Samples have noise correlations as in CMSSW
- OOT pileup of 50 with 25ns spacing at eta=2.8

To compile and run:
g++ -o exercise_11 exercise_11.cc PulseChiSqSNNLS.cc -std=c++11 `root-config --cflags --glibs`
./exercise_11

Histograms are stored in "output.root" file
